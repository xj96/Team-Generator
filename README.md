# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Description

For this assignment I had to make an app that takes the user's input and generates an html file with that input in the document body. First I wrote the classes, then I tested the classes to see if they pass and work properly, then I wrote the questions for each type of employee, and finally pushed the user's input to the html document.
